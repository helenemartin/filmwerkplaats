If only we could reproduce the brain’s function that operates when we are dreaming and call it art: a randomisation of memories and lived experiences arrayed in the most surprising ways each night and broadcast it?

Viktor Skvolsky expressed such an idea: the slot machine depicted in Literature and Cinematography: (1923):

“In 1917 someone published a carefully researched article which reported that screenwriters, exhausted by work, had concocted a machine that produced plots. 
Imagine a row of films wound on special spools. One of the reels contains people’s professions, the second one- countries of the world, the third one-various ages, the fourth one-human acts (for example kissing, climbing a pipe, knocking someone down, jumping into the water, shooting). A person takes hold of this crank and spins them. Then he peers through a special slot and reads the resulting gibberish”

Within the last years, I have accumulated fragments of 16mm found footage, which I have hand-processed and hand-printed for the sake of experiment and colour. This has resulted in a huge amount of footage, but I cannot call it an archive since this would imply a taxonomic system! Aggregate Functions will seek to produce this system: it will generate logically structured montages that will nevertheless be unique each time they are projected. 

I wanted to explore the idea of a randomizing web app for Filmwerplaats, an independant filmlab in Rotterdam.

My AWS bucket was hacked so I decided to leave this project.

I am starting all over from scratch using Pinterest as a template with [Eppinglette](https://epinglette.herokuapp.com/)
