<h2>About</h2>
<p>“In 1917 someone published a carefully researched article which reported
that
screenwriters, exhausted by work, had concocted a machine that produced
plots.
Imagine a row of films wound on special spools. One of the reels contains
people’s professions, the second one- countries of the world, the third
one-various ages, the fourth one-human acts (for example kissing, climbing
a
pipe, knocking someone down, jumping into the water, shooting). A person
takes
hold of this crank and spins them.
Then he peers through a special slot and reads the resulting gibberish.
The machine is rather strange, but apparently it gives American the jolt
they
require”[1]
