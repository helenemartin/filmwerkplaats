# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about_page:
    paragraph: "In 1917 someone published a carefully researched article which reported that screenwriters, exhausted by work, had concocted a machine that produced plots.Imagine a row of films wound on special spools. One of the reels contains peopleâ€™s professions, the second one- countries of the world, the third one-various ages, the fourth one-human acts (for example kissing, climbing a pipe, knocking someone down, jumping into the water, shooting). A person takes hold of this crank and spins them. Then he peers through a special slot and reads the resulting gibberish. The machine is rather strange, but apparently it gives American the jolt they require [*]."
    reference: "[*]In Shklovsky, Viktor, Literature and Cinematography, 1905, p 43."
    bottom: "Filmwerkplaats'plot machine is inspired by Sklovsky's comment. It aims at classifying 16mm film fragments handfully picked from the film archive of Filmwerkplaats, Rotterdam. Through programming, the foundations for an online taxonomic system are explored. This project is a preliminary sketch for this plot machine that instead of beeing spun is generated automatically on this Rails application to perhaps generate different meanings each time a tag is clicked."
